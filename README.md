## Building ```jupyter-book```

Assuming that you have <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html">jupyter-book</a> installed you can generate
and html version of the notebooks by issuing on the top level directory the following

```
jupyter-book build notes/
```

The command above will create a ```notebooks/_build``` directory.  Note that you make have to copy the ```imgs/``` into the  
```notebooks/_build```
